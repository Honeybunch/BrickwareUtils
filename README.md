## How to Build

This repo can be built on its own but is designed to be included as a submodule in another project. The included CMakeLists.txt should work just fine to build the project but has not been tested on its own. 

Just invoke CMake on the project and then build with Visual Studio, Make or whatever you'd like!

###Dependencies

None!
